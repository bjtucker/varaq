Welcome to <i>var'aq</i>, the first language designed for the Klingon
programmer!<p>

<i>var'aq</i> is the first-ever attempt to get an idea of the technical
culture and tools of <a href="http://www.startrek.com">Star Trek's</a> 
Klingon Empire. It was motivated by a love of created languages and
cultures, as well as a desire to see how far human programming paradigms
can be stretched (and believe me, it can go a lot further...)<p>

This page is a quick guide to the contents of the <i>var'aq</i>
distribution as well as a link to the <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq">website</a>. <p>
