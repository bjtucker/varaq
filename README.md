This is var'aq, the first Klingon programming language. This is the
Azetbur ('aDSetbur?) release, dated 1/05/2001, named for the Klingon
chancellor Azetbur gorqon puqbe' in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered
Country. 

It is to be considered an alpha release; for information on what
it's capable of, see the files current.html and gettingstarted.txt. 

var'aq was developed on a Linux system using Perl 5. If you are not currently
using a Unix-based system, you may want to rename the interpreter files
(varaq-engl and varaq-kling) with a .pl extension.

If this is your first exposure to var'aq, please read the FAQ
(varaqfaq.html) before you do anything else. You may also wish to
subscribe to our eGroups mailing list; the information is in the FAQ.

Thank you, enjoy, and Qapla'!
