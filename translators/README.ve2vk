This ve2vk package was created by varaq-dev list member j proctor (I have
his email address somewhere, but not immediately at hand :-) ). It will be
used to create future versions of varaq-kling. If you have any problems
with this you'll want to contact him (via the list; see 

http://www.egroups.com/group/varaq-dev

for info on how to join.)
