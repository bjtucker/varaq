<h3>Version Information</h3>

This is the status of the <i>var'aq</i> project as of 12 August 2001. <p>

This is the <b>pre-<i>martoq</i> 0.5</b> release, after the Klingon general who
became chancellor after tbe death of Gowron. It is still a work in progress,
and the final <i>martoq</i> release package will be available some time in
late August or early September.<p>

<h3>Status Summary</h3><p>

Lists currently exist, though the file support remains undefined. <p>

Thanks to Jeff Evarts (bug fixes, list support) and Merrick J. Stemens (spec
suggestions and an upcoming VB version).<p>

<h3>Interpreter Status</h3><p>

The Klingon and English interpreters in the process of being unified; there
should be no problems running either type of <i>var'aq</i> program through the
interpreter, and since I was a bit lazy about it you can mix and match
languages as you choose.<p>

Jeff Evarts has added the basics of list support; big thanks go to him for
that.</p>

The following keywords are currently supported:<p>

<ul>
<li>Control Structures

	<li><b>cos/joqHa'</b>
	<li><b>tan/qojmI'</b>
	<li><b>atan/qojHa'</b>
	<li><b>ln/ghurtaH</b>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Relational Operators<p>

All relational operators have been implemented. Thanks to j proctor for <b>null?/pagh'a', negative?/taH'a', int?/HabmI''a'</b>, and <b>number/mI''a'</b>.<p>

<li>I/O Operators<p>

The <i>var'aq</i> I/O model remains to be defined, but the basic console I/O functions are now present.  <p>

<li>List Operators<p>

All list operators are now available, though I still need a Klingon word for
<b>consume</b>. <p>

<li>String Operators<p>

The current set of operators is sufficient to implement the others in the spec, but they are a lower priority.</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>strtie/tlheghrar</b>
	<li><b>streq?/tlheghrap'a'</b>
	<li><b>strcut/tlhleghpe'</b>
	<li><b>strmeasure/tlheghjuv</b>
	<li><b>compose/naQmoH</b>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation Issues and/or Bug Fixes</h4><p>

<ul>
	<li>The interpreter now knows to ignore hashbang (i.e. #!/usr/bin/varaq-whatever) lines. They can double as end-of-line comments if you like, but you really shouldn't; these are here primarily to allow the forthcoming <i>vqmake</i> program to spit out program files that a Unix shell can execute directly (which would be .vqx files on any other platform).
	<li>Took the "\t" out of disp/cha' to facilitate a possible CGI conversion. Better formatted output will be a priority very shortly.
	<li>The interpreter also doesn't see lines beginning with //. This is to allow for static linking of .vql files (though if someone wants to implement <i>var'aq</i> "shared libraries" I'll be glad to add the revs to the interpreter).
	<li>Cleaned up the execution logic a bit -- the code to execute a proc object was already in there about four times and was about to go in again for compose/naqmoH, so I abstracted it into a routine called execblock() per Chris' advice (RTFC).
	<li>Merged in j proctor's additions.
</ul>

<h3>Specification Status</h3><p>

A few changes:<p>
<ul>
	<li>A number of operators have been added:
	<ul>
		<li><b>//<i>name</i></b> -- equivalent to C <code>#include</code>.
		<li>Numerous "constants" (actually more like environment variables).
	</ul>
	<li>Several operators have been renamed:
	<ul>
		<li><b>strcat</b> is now <b>strtie</b> to bring it in line with the Klingon <b>tlheghrar</b>.
		<li>The basic arithmetic operators have been given new
Klingon names to coincide with recent additions to the Klingon linguistic
canon.
	</ul>
	<li>More coinages in the section headings.
</ul>
