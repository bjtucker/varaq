<h3>Version Information</h3>

This is the status of the <i>var'aq</i> project as of 20 September 2000. <p>

This is the <b>Azetbur</b> release, after Chancellor Gorkon's daughter and successor in <i>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</i>.<p>

<h3>Status Summary</h3><p>

We are moving ahead! Console I/O (on a very rudimentary level) is here, as well as much of the mathematical functionality and string handling. Lists are not here yet, and a more robust I/O model must await a better understanding of Klingon hacker culture to understand issues like authentication and how distributed processing might be used. <p>

This release is approaching usability. Files are not here yet (still under discussion), but there is console-level I/O and enough string support to do something useful. <p>

<a href="mailto:jproctor@oit.umass.edu">j proctor</a> from the <i>varaq-dev</i> mailing list has contributed some sample code and a more flexible translator program than the one I wrote and distributed. His interpreter will be found in the <i>translators</i> directory.<p>

<h3>Interpreter Status</h3><p>

The interpreter is available with both Klingon and English keywords; however, keep in mind that maintenance is done mostly on the English version and the translator program is not ready for prime time. This will be fixed eventually.<p>

The following keywords are currently supported:<p>

<ul>
<li>Control Structures
<ul>
	<li><b>ifyes/HIja'chugh</b>
	<li><b>ifno/ghobe'chugh</b>
	<li><b>choose/wIv</b>
	<li><b>~ (quote/lI'moH)</b>

<li>Stack Operations
<ul>
	<li><b>pop/woD</b>
	<li><b>dup/latlh</b>

	<li><b>howmuch/'ar</b>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Trig/Log operators
<ul>
	<li><b>sin/joq</b>
	<li><b>cos/joqHa'</b>
	<li><b>tan/qojmI'</b>
	<li><b>atan/qojHa'</b>
	<li><b>ln/ghurtaH</b>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Relational Operators<p>

All relational operators have been implemented. Thanks to j proctor for <b>null?/pagh'a', negative?/taH'a', int?/HabmI''a'</b>, and <b>number/mI''a'</b>.<p>

<li>I/O Operators<p>

The <i>var'aq</i> I/O model remains to be defined, but the basic console I/O functions are now present.  <p>

<li>List Operators<p>

List support does not exist yet.<p>

<li>String Operators<p>

The current set of operators is sufficient to implement the others in the spec, but they are a lower priority.</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>strtie/tlheghrar</b>
	<li><b>streq?/tlheghrap'a'</b>
	<li><b>strcut/tlhleghpe'</b>
	<li><b>strmeasure/tlheghjuv</b>
	<li><b>compose/naQmoH</b>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation Issues and/or Bug Fixes</h4><p>

<ul>
	<li>The interpreter now knows to ignore hashbang (i.e. #!/usr/bin/varaq-whatever) lines. They can double as end-of-line comments if you like, but you really shouldn't; these are here primarily to allow the forthcoming <i>vqmake</i> program to spit out program files that a Unix shell can execute directly (which would be .vqx files on any other platform). 
	<li>Took the "\t" out of disp/cha' to facilitate a possible CGI conversion. Better formatted output will be a priority very shortly.
	<li>The interpreter also doesn't see lines beginning with //. This is to allow for static linking of .vql files (though if someone wants to implement <i>var'aq</i> "shared libraries" I'll be glad to add the revs to the interpreter). 
	<li>Cleaned up the execution logic a bit -- the code to execute a proc object was already in there about four times and was about to go in again for compose/naqmoH, so I abstracted it into a routine called execblock() per Chris' advice (RTFC). 
	<li>Merged in j proctor's additions.
</ul>

<h3>Specification Status</h3><p>

A few changes:<p>
<ul>
	<li>A number of operators have been added:
	<ul>
		<li><b>//<i>name</i></b> -- equivalent to C <code>#include</code>. 
		<li>Numerous "constants" (actually more like environment variables).
	</ul>
	<li>Several operators have been renamed:
	<ul>
		<li><b>strcat</b> is now <b>strtie</b> to bring it in line with the Klingon <b>tlheghrar</b>.
		<li>The basic arithmetic operators have been given new
Klingon names to coincide with recent additions to the Klingon linguistic
canon. 
	</ul>
	<li>More coinages in the section headings. 
</ul>
